*(Suggestion: Take a good screenshot of your app showing a generated report and upload it to your GitHub repo, then replace `<URL_TO_YOUR_SCREENSHOT_IMAGE_HERE>` with the direct link to that image in the repo).*

## 📋 Project Overview

The AI Wall Street Analyst is a proof-of-concept web application that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to automatically generate basic equity research reports for U.S. stock tickers. Users can input a valid ticker symbol, and the application will fetch relevant financial data, process it through Google's Gemini LLM, and render a 10-section analytical report.

This project (V1.0) serves as a demonstration of end-to-end AI product development, from initial requirements and cloud-based development to deployment on a cloud platform. The primary goal was to create a functional, shareable application showcasing data fetching, LLM interaction, and dynamic report generation.

## ✨ Key Features (V1.0)

*   **Web-Based Ticker Input:** Simple UI for entering a U.S. stock ticker.
*   **Automated Data Fetching:** Utilizes the `yfinance` library to retrieve company information, quote data, financial summaries, and news.
*   **AI-Powered Report Generation:** Employs Google's Gemini (`gemini-1.5-flash`) API via the `google-generativeai` library to generate all 10 sections of the report.
*   **Comprehensive 10-Section Report:** Includes:
    1.  Executive Summary / Snapshot (with AI-generated FVE & Rating)
    2.  Business Description
    3.  Business Strategy & Outlook
    4.  Economic Moat Analysis
    5.  Financial Analysis (summary of latest annuals)
    6.  Valuation Analysis (conceptual)
    7.  Risk and Uncertainty Assessment
    8.  Bulls Say / Bears Say
    9.  Conclusion & Investment Recommendation (restating FVE & Rating from Section 1)
    10. References
*   **Dynamic Report Display:** Renders the generated markdown report directly within the Streamlit web interface.
*   **API Key Security:** Secure management of the Google Gemini API key using Streamlit Community Cloud secrets.
*   **Consistency Check:** Ensures Fair Value Estimate (FVE) and Rating from Section 1 are accurately parsed and restated in Section 9.
*   **Clear Disclaimers:** Highlights the POC nature and that content is not financial advice.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

*   **Language:** Python 3.12
*   **Core Libraries:**
    *   Streamlit (Web UI framework)
    *   `google-generativeai` (for Google Gemini API)
    *   `yfinance` (for stock data)
    *   `pandas` (for data manipulation by yfinance)
    *   `python-dotenv` (for local environment variable management)
*   **Development Environment:** Google Cloud Shell
*   **Version Control:** Git & GitHub
*   **Deployment Platform:** Streamlit Community Cloud (SCC)
*   **LLM:** Google Gemini (`gemini-1.5-flash`)

## 🚀 How to Use / Test

1.  Visit the live application: [https://aiwsav10-fh8pkwqjqhy6gkzyzrttev.streamlit.app/](https://aiwsav10-fh8pkwqjqhy6gkzyzrttev.streamlit.app/)
2.  Enter a valid U.S. stock ticker symbol (e.g., AAPL, MSFT, NVDA, GOOG) into the input field.
3.  Click the "Generate Report" button.
4.  Please allow a minute or two for the report to generate, as it involves multiple API calls and LLM processing steps.

## 📁 Project Structure

*   `app.py`: Main Streamlit application file; handles UI and report generation orchestration.
*   `config_loader.py`: Manages API key loading from Streamlit secrets or environment variables.
*   `data_fetcher.py`: Class (`StockDataFetcher`) responsible for fetching data using `yfinance`.
*   `llm_handler.py`: Functions for configuring and interacting with the Google Gemini API.
*   `report_generator.py`: Contains functions for generating each specific section of the report and assembling the final output.
*   `requirements.txt`: Lists Python dependencies for the project.
*   `.gitignore`: Specifies intentionally untracked files (e.g., `.env`, `venv/`).

## 🔮 Future Enhancements (Potential V2.0+)

*   Refined UI/UX with more granular loading indicators.
*   Option to download reports (e.g., as Markdown or PDF).
*   Support for a wider range of international tickers.
*   Integration of charts and graphs for visual data representation.
*   More advanced analytical sections or deeper financial metric analysis.
*   Deployment to other cloud platforms (e.g., GCP Cloud Run, AWS Elastic Beanstalk).

**How to Add/Update the README.md in Your GitHub Repository:**

You'll do this from your Google Cloud Shell environment.

1.  **Navigate to your project directory in Cloud Shell:**
    ```bash
    cd ~/ai_analyst_webapp
    ```

2.  **Create or Open `README.md`:**
    *   If you don't have a `README.md` file yet, you can create it.
    *   If you already have one (GitHub might have created a basic one), you'll be editing it.
    *   Use the Cloud Shell Editor (recommended for easy copy-pasting) or `nano`:
        *   **Cloud Shell Editor:** Click the "Open Editor" icon, find your `ai_analyst_webapp` folder in the explorer, and either create a new file named `README.md` or open the existing one.
        *   **Nano:**
            ```bash
            nano README.md
            ```

3.  **Paste the Content:**
    *   Copy the entire Markdown content drafted above.
    *   Paste it into the `README.md` file in your editor.

4.  **Add a Screenshot (Important for Visual Appeal):**
    *   **Take a good screenshot** of your live Streamlit app, preferably showing part of a generated report (like the first page you showed me with the NVDA report).
    *   **Upload the screenshot to your GitHub repository:**
        1.  Go to your repository on GitHub.com (`https://github.com/soodr321/ai_wsa_v1.0`).
        2.  Click on "Add file" -> "Upload files".
        3.  Drag and drop your screenshot image (e.g., `app_screenshot.png`) or use the file chooser.
        4.  Commit the file directly to the `main` branch.
    *   **Get the URL of the uploaded image:**
        1.  Once uploaded, navigate to the image file within your repository on GitHub.
        2.  Click on the image.
        3.  You should see a "Download" button. Right-click on the "Download" button and select "Copy Link Address" (or similar wording depending on your browser). This link is usually a direct link to the raw image file. Alternatively, if viewing the image directly, the URL in your browser bar might be the raw image URL (often starting with `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/...`).
        *(A simpler way if you're having trouble with the raw link: after uploading, view the image in GitHub, right-click the image itself and select "Copy Image Address")*
    *   **Update the README:** Go back to your `README.md` file in the Cloud Shell Editor. Replace `![AI Wall Street Analyst Screenshot](<URL_TO_YOUR_SCREENSHOT_IMAGE_HERE>)` with:
        `![AI Wall Street Analyst Screenshot](YOUR_COPIED_IMAGE_URL)`

5.  **Save the `README.md` file:**
    *   **Cloud Shell Editor:** `Ctrl+S` (or `Cmd+S`).
    *   **Nano:** `Ctrl+X`, then `Y` (to confirm saving), then `Enter`.

6.  **Commit and Push the `README.md` to GitHub:**
    *   In your Cloud Shell terminal:
        ```bash
        git add README.md
        git commit -m "Docs: Add comprehensive README for project"
        # If you had to pull remote changes first (like before):
        # git pull origin main --no-rebase (handle merge if necessary)
        git push origin main
        ```

Once pushed, go to your GitHub repository page. The `README.md` content will be beautifully rendered below your file list, serving as the homepage for your project!

Let me know if you want any adjustments to the README draft!
